# SortAnalyzer-Java
JavaSortingSuite: Exploring Bubble, Insertion, and Quick Sort Algorithms in Java
# Java Sorting Suite

## Project Overview

The Java Sorting Suite is a comprehensive Java application designed to analyze and compare the performance of various sorting algorithms. This project provides a detailed exploration of Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Quick Sort, applied to arrays of different sizes (10, 100, 1,000, and 10,000 integers). The primary goal is to evaluate these algorithms based on their operation times, offering insights into their efficiency and practical use cases.

## Features

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implements Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Quick Sort.
- **Performance Analysis**: Compares the time taken by each sorting algorithm to process lists of varying lengths.
- **Java Implementation**: Developed using popular Java classes like `Scanner` and `Array`.
- **User-Friendly Console Interface**: Guides users through selecting an array size and displays sorting results.

## Background

Sorting algorithms are fundamental in computer science, often used for organizing large datasets. Each algorithm has its unique characteristics in terms of time complexity, memory usage, stability, adaptability, and whether they are comparison-based. This project aims to provide a practical comparison of these algorithms in a user-friendly manner.

## How It Works

The application prompts the user to choose the length of the array (10, 100, 1,000, or 10,000 integers). Based on the selection, it generates an array of random integers and applies each sorting algorithm to the array. The program then measures and compares the time taken for each sorting method, providing an analysis of their performance.

## Technical Details

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **IDE**: Eclipse IDE for Java Developers Version: 2022-03 (4.23.0)
- **Platform**: macOS Monterey

## Sorting Algorithms

### Bubble Sort
- **Description**: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- **Best For**: Educational purposes and small datasets.

### Insertion Sort
- **Description**: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms like quicksort.
- **Best For**: Small datasets and partially sorted arrays.

### Quick Sort
- **Description**: An efficient sorting algorithm, serving as a systematic method for placing the elements of an array in order.
- **Best For**: Large datasets.
